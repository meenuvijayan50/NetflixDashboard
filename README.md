# NetflixDashboard
Exploring datasets of Netflix of TV shows and Movies on the Platform. In this
Dashboard, we are going to explore the dataset from Kaggle and we would like to find out how long the
Netflix platform takes a movie or a TV show to release on its platform, how many movies and TV
shows are released in specific time frame, how many movies and TV shows are releaseed by different countries,
and what were the top 10 genres that the audience of the Netflix platform
liked the most. From here, we would like to apply TABLEAU approach to visualize the data
fully.
